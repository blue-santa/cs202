Wulf and Eadwacer

Possibly whoever had given a gift to my tribe—
they would chew him up if he came with a company.
            It is not like that with us.

Wulf is on one island, I am on another.
It’s strong there, surrounded by swamps.
Slaughter-fierce men crowd there—
they would chew him up if he came with a company.
            It is not like that with us.

I wondered with hope on my Wulf’s wide wanderings
when there was rainy weather and I sat weeping,
when the battle-bold wrapped me up in his arms,
it was my delight — but it was hateful as well.

Wulf, my Wulf! My hopes for you
have sickened, your seldom visits—
a mourning mind—I’m not hungry—

Do you hear me, Eadwacer? Wulf bears
our wretched whelp into the woods.

One may easily sever 
what was never bound fast,
our mutual riddling…
