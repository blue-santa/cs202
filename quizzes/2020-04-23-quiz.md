# V605 -- Function Templates

#### Bryan Beus

## What reason would you need to use template specialization
 
If the compiler can potentially use the inputs in the wrong manner, we should indicate the proper input type using specialization. For example, an `int` vs a `double` may potentially lead to confusion, if no specifier is in place.

## If you have a return type T and no parameter using it which of the following lines of code will work?

The second one, the one with `<int>`.

```
    std::cout << myfunction() << std::endl;
    std::cout << myfunction<int> ()  << std::endl;
```
