# V601 -- Aggregation and Inheritance

#### Bryan Beus

##  What is the difference between aggregation and inheritance?

Aggregation "has" something. So, a class HAS a private data member, for example. 

Inheritance "is" something. For example, a ostringstream IS an ostream.

##  What is an interesting object to you that needs a HAS-A relationship?

An example would be an Employee class that calls a Address class.

The Employee class HAS-A Address class.

##  What is an interesting object to you that needs an IS-A relationship?

An example might be a Vehicle class as a base class, and then a Stationwagon class that IS-A inherited class.
