# V503 -- Overloaded Operators II

#### Bryan Beus

## Why should the parameter for Foo::operator+ be a reference to const or pass by value?

Overloaded arithmetic operators should be free functions, because the member function version cannot do conversions of the first parameter.

## Why should you write operators in terms of other operators?

This allows us to avoid repeating ourselves. We set an initial overloaded operator that performs a preliminary function, and then have the second overloaded operator complete the function. This allows for overloaded operators that can perform in either the simpler of the operators (`+`) or more complex (`+=`) form.

## What is the difference in syntax between a global overloaded operator and a member overloaded operator?

A global overloaded operator:

```
ostream& operator<< (ostream& os, int myData) {
    return &os;
}
```

A member overloaded operator:

```
Foo& Foo::operator<< (const Foo& foo, int myData) {
    return *this;
};
```
