# V504 -- Static, Friend, Enum

#### Bryan Beus

## Why should you prefer enum class over enum?

Using enum class allows us to control scope. This is advantageous, as the names in the enum values can become a challenging factor to manage if the scope is not well organized.

Also, the new enum class is preferred because it is typesafe.

The old style of enums allow for implicit conversion to and from an integer.

## What kind of data is an enum?

`enum` are integers that have a name inside of it.

The compiler can recognize the name, thus creating an easier way to access the data.

## What is the difference between internal and external linkage?

An internally linked variable is visible only within the "translation unit" (or file) in which it is called.

An externally linked variable is visible throughout the entire program. 

To declare a variable as internal, use the `static` specifier.

To import a global variable, use the `extern` specifier.

If the linkage is not specified, the default linkage is `extern` for non-const symbols, and `static` for `const` symbols.
