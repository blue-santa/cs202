# V604 -- Class Templates

#### Bryan Beus

## What is generic programming all about?

Sometimes we create code that is similar (or identical) in functionality, except that it can operator on different types.

For example, we in the lecture we watch an example of creating a `swap` function that can perform the same operation on `float` objects that it also performs on `int` objects.

## When does C++ generate the actual source code for a template class?

The compiler creates the source code for a template class when a function calls that specific type.
