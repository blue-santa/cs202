# V603 -- Polymorphism II

#### Bryan Beus

## What problem can occur if you do not use a virtual destructor?

One problem is that when you create a derived object as a pointer to the base class, when the destructor is called it may not align to the correct destructor.

Furthermore, I did some additional research on this beyond the video, out of curiosity, and read about how this can lead to a memory leak. 

## What kind of code should you put in child classes? parent classes?

Functions should be declared as `virtual` in the base (parent) class.

The functions are then defined in the child (derived) classes. Use the `override` specifier as a best practice.
